# Music-Store-SQL
Hi, I'm Monika

In this project, Iâ€™ve utilized SQL within SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to solve various analytical questions based on a music store database. The goal was to explore and analyze data to gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and musical preferences.

What This Project Covers: 
Identifying top customers by revenue Analyzing popular music genres and top artists Calculating total sales by country Exploring album and track details

Tools & Skills: 
SQL [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)] Data analysis using JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, subqueries, CTE, and aggregate functions Querying relational databases and interpreting business-related data

This project highlights how SQL can be applied to real-world datasets to extract meaningful insights and support data-driven decision-making.
